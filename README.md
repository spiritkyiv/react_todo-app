# React Todo App Load Todos

[DEMO LINK](https://spiritkyiv.github.io/react_todo-app-loading-todos/)

## Error messages

In case of any error show the notification with an appropriate message at the bottom (just remove the `hidden` class).

- the notification can be closed with the `close` button (add the `hidden` class);
- automatically hide the notification in 3 seconds;
- also hide the notification before any next request;
- use a wrong todos URL to test the error.

## Filtering todos

Filter todos by status `All` / `Active` / `Completed`:

- an active filter link should be hightlighted;
- don't hide everything if todos are just filtered out.
